# Webscrapping-job-vacancies-in-Latin-America

#About

This project webscrappes online job vacancies webpages in Latin America. 

## Justification

Online job portals have grown all over the globe during the past decades. 
In Latin America and the Caribbean, some portals are an increasingly important instrument
of labor market intermediation.
Moreover, these portals provide real-time and massive buckets of information on job-specific skill demands (Cedefop, 2018),
with good regional and occupational granularity.
Most sites have well structured and detailed indicators on each job posting.
To our knowledge there is no single source of comparable online job vacancy statistics for the Latin America and the Caribbean region.

## Objectives

The project's aim is twofold: 
(i) to create a vacancies time series, and
(ii) to apply ML to create skill contents variables/indicators from that data.

## Methods

Taking advantage from the fact that most sites simoultaneously provide services for a group of countries, webscrapping methods that
map one portal's architecture can potentially be used in several countries at once.
